# **DATA_6150_Individual_Project**
## Energy Demand Forecasting Using Time-Series Models
This project focuses on forecasting energy demand using various time-series models such as Naïve, Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, and SARIMA.

## Key Objectives:
1. Forecast energy demand 24 hours ahead with high accuracy.
2. Identify and analyze seasonal patterns in energy consumption data.
3. Evaluate the performance of models like Naïve, Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, SARIMA, and Linear Regression.
4. Provide actionable insights for optimizing energy grid operations and minimizing forecast errors.
5. Highlight the implications of model accuracy for real-time energy management.

# Setup and Usage
## Prerequisites
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- pmdarima
- sktime
- scikit-learn
  
## Installation
1. Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name`

2. Install the required dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Code
1. Place the dataset DUQ_hourly.csv in the data/ directory.
2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook Individual_Project.ipynb to:
- Preprocess the dataset.
- Visualize seasonal trends and patterns.
- Train and evaluate forecasting models.
3. Alternatively, execute Data_6150_Individual_Project_Annanahmed_code.py to generate forecasts.
