This project focuses on forecasting energy demand within the PJM regional transmission organization, which coordinates wholesale electricity for multiple U.S. states. Using hourly energy consumption data, this study aims to provide accurate demand forecasts that will assist grid operators in managing energy supply effectively. Accurate forecasting is critical for minimizing operational costs and ensuring energy reliability. This analysis will explore various time series models and backtest their performances, ultimately selecting the most suitable method based on accuracy and robustness.
